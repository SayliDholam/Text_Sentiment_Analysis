# Text_Sentiment_Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on user-input text or CSV datasets, focusing on
identifying and categorizing opinions as positive, negative, or neutral. This
project addresses the growing need for efficient sentiment analysis across various
languages (English, Hindi, Marathi) and supports translation for non-English
inputs. </br>
The app processes user inputs, conducts polarity and subjectivity analysis,
and visualizes the results through detailed graphical representations and tabular
data. Additionally, the project offers functionality for CSV file uploads, enabling
the batch analysis of text, and provides downloadable reports.
