# Text_Sentiment_Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on user-input text or CSV datasets, focusing on
identifying and categorizing opinions as positive, negative, or neutral. This
project addresses the growing need for efficient sentiment analysis across various
languages (English, Hindi, Marathi) and supports translation for non-English
inputs. </br>
The app processes user inputs, conducts polarity and subjectivity analysis,
and visualizes the results through detailed graphical representations and tabular
data. Additionally, the project offers functionality for CSV file uploads, enabling
the batch analysis of text, and provides downloadable reports.

## Technologies Used :
- **Streamlit :** <br/>
Streamlit is an open-source Python framework for building interactive web applications for data science and machine learning. It allows developers to create user-friendly apps quickly, using simple Python scripts without needing extensive front-end knowledge. Its intuitive API helps display charts, tables, and other media directly in the browser, making it ideal for data visualization projects and analytics dashboards.</br>
``` pip install streamlit ```
<br/><br/>

- **Pandas :** <br/>
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library in Python widely used for handling and analyzing structured data. It offers data structures like DataFrames to store, filter, aggregate, and perform complex data transformations efficiently. Pandas is often used in data preprocessing stages, as well as for importing and exporting data to and from various formats, such as CSV and Excel.</br>
``` pip install pandas ```
<br/><br/>

- **TextBlob :**  <br/>
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents with a flexible schema. This makes it different from traditional relational databases, which store data in rows and columns.</br></br>
Download MongoDB:</br>
Go to the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and select the version that matches your operating system.</br></br>
Install MongoDB:</br>
Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard.</br>
During installation, you can select the "Complete" setup type to install all MongoDB components.</br>
Ensure that the option to install MongoDB as a service is checked.</br></br>
Set up MongoDB Environment:</br>
After installation, you need to create directories for data and logs.</br>
``` md \data\db``` ```md \data\log ``` </br></br>
Run MongoDB:</br>
Open a command prompt and start the MongoDB server by running:</br>
``` "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{your_version}\bin\mongod.exe" ```</br></br>
Connecting to MongoDB:</br>
To interact with MongoDB, you can use the MongoDB shell or a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass.</br></br>
Using MongoDB with Python</br>
```pip install pymongo```</br></br>
Python Script:</br>
